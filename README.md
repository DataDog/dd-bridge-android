# Datadog Bridge for Android

> A simplified bridge used to support cross-platform mobile frameworks.

This project provides a simplified API to use Datadog features within cross-platform mobile frameworks such as React Native. It follows the mobile bridge API defined in the [dd-mobile-bridge](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-mobile-bridge) repository 

**Note**: If you're building a native Android application, please use the [dd-sdk-android](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-android) library instead.
